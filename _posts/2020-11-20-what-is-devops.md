In this post I want to talk about my perspective on hiring a *<q>DevOps
Engineer</q>*, why I believe it looks **quite bad** for a business to advertise
for a position in *that* role, and if I identify as DevOps Engineer.

I was recently reading a thread on LinkedIn about a rant on a job offer posted
by a recruiter. A question that I believed genuine and that stroke me the most
was:

> What is DevOps, then?

Ranting on recruiters and the hiring process is a common attitude that I can't
see going away any time soon; however, I may write a separate post with my
point of view, and I bet it is going to be an uncommon one.

Reading that question, and the entire thread, triggered me and made me want to
spell it out myself: I wanted to do that for so long. Luckily, my new habit
decided to kick in: I paused. Feels awkward all the times, but that lead me to
ask myself: is it really possible that nobody has already written something
accurate about DevOps? Of course, they did.

### What is DevOps, then?
Do you know who has a surprisingly outstanding page about DevOps?
[AWS][what-is-devops]. My surprise is most certainly rooted in my biases toward
Amazon as a business, but the page is spot on, from the very first line:

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools

The choice of words and the order in which they have been used is perfect.
First and foremost, DevOps started as a [cultural
philosophy][devops-cultural-philosophy]. The concept of DevOps emerged out of a
discussion between Andrew Clay and Patrick Debois in 2008: they wanted to
change the way people worked in the IT environment. They needed a shift in the
mindset, first. If you want to read more about the story of DevOps,
[devops.com][devops-com] has an accurate [timeline][the-origin-of-devops]. What
came next was a comprehensive set of [best practices][devops-best-practices]
[^practices] to go along with this new way of working. Last but not least, the
will to adopt those new practices created the need for new tools.

Identifying DevOps as the set of tools to automate the IT infrastructure is, I
believe, one of the reasons why most business are only scratching the surface
of its potentials.

### What is a DevOps Engineer, then?
Any engineer that follows the DevOps cultural philosophy and best practices. Is
it an IT role? Not really: it only says how you would work, not what would you
do. Does it bother me to read *DevOps engineer* as a role in any job offer? It
used to, now I regard it as an indicator of the quality of the business: it
clearly shows that they didn't get it and this comes with all sorts of
implications. What about *<q>the DevOps guy in my team</q>*? The very sentence
*<q>the DevOps guy in my team</q>* is what the DevOps culture wants to move
away from: competence siloing. That sentence is micro-scale competence siloing,
with some sugar coating. That sentence is an indication of how much your
organization is falling short on improving the IT working environment and its
performance; it is highly likely that your organization has just jumped on
board of the DevOps bandwagon without actually knowing what it is.

### Am I a DevOps Engineer?
I really don't like to put any label on anybody, but I'm so fond of the
culture and principles of DevOps, that they are now part of me.

Yes, Yes I am.

[^practices]: Here I would move a critique to the page: *<q>Communication and
              Collaboration</q>* should have been listed as the first of the
              best practices, as it is the only one you can't succeed without.
              However, I can't really blame them: their core business is to
              sell, and they can't sell *<q>Communication and
              Collaboration</q>*.
